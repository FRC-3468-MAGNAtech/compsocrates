/**
 * Computes everything that needs writing once a live alliance is fully
 * scouted (one entry per robot of the alliance) and the official match has posted scores
 * — shared by the immediate client-side check (right after a scout
 * submits) and the server-side `/api/cron/poll-live-scores` /
 * `/api/live/check-scores` routes (Admin SDK). Pure — no Firestore access
 * — so it's identical either way and fully unit-testable. Returns `null`
 * if the match hasn't posted a score yet; the caller is expected to have
 * already confirmed both entries exist.
 *
 * Session flags reuse P4's `evaluatePracticeSessionFlags` directly (Zero
 * Entries / Unrealistic Entry — the only two of its four flags that make
 * sense here: live matches have no video to finish early against, and
 * "repeat attempt" doesn't apply to a real match that only happens once).
 * Entry-level `autoFlags` reuse the full `evaluateAutoFlagRuleIds` +
 * `FlagContext`, the same convention `lib/analytics/recompute.ts` uses for
 * every other real-event entry, so Match Analytics treats these
 * identically — `sameTeamEntries` is deliberately left empty rather than
 * querying the rest of this team's event history, a scope simplification
 * for live mode (see docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md, P7).
