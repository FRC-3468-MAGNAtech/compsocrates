// What the Credits page shows until an admin edits it (P14). Nothing is written
// to Firestore for these — the first edit materialises them into
// `credits/{teamId}` (store.ts), which is why every id here is fixed: an edit
// made against the defaults has to find the same section and entry ids when it's
// replayed on the stored copy.
//
// The built-with list reflects what the project really uses: the app is Next.js
// (App Router) on React, not Vite — see docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md (P14).
