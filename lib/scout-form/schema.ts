// P21: this module used to HOLD a hard-coded form and its scoring. The form definition now lives in schema v2 (lib/forms/*): the types in lib/forms/types.ts,
// the validator in lib/forms/validate.ts, scoring in lib/forms/scoring.ts, and each game's form is a built-in assembled from its game definition
// (lib/forms/builtin.ts). What remains here are the pre-v2 names, as thin aliases, so existing imports (and the tests written against them) keep
// resolving. New code should import from `@/lib/forms/*` directly and read forms through the store/context.
