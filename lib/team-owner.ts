// P20: the two kinds of owner, as pure logic (no React, no Firebase) shared by the server routes, the UI and the tests.
//
//   Platform owner: a uid in RELEASE_OWNER_UIDS, or a verified email in RELEASE_OWNER_EMAILS (server-only). Approves team applications, switches team
//                   creation on/off, and can force-transfer an account for recovery. Carried as the `platformOwner`
//                   custom claim (+ the `users.isPlatformOwner` mirror for the UI). Always an admin of their own account.
//   Team owner:     `teams/{teamId}.ownerUid`: the one owner *inside* a team account. This is what the FIX2 protections,
//                   the "Owner" badge and ownership transfer follow. `users.isOwner` is a mirror of it that only the
//                   server routes write, in the same transaction as `ownerUid`, so the UI can read it from the roster.
