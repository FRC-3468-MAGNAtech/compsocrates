 * client (right after the second of a pair submits) or from
 * `resolveLobbyResults` (Admin SDK, the actual writer — see
 * docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md, P8, for why a pair's own two sessions can't just
 * write this onto each other directly under firestore.rules). Unlike live
 * mode's `resolveLiveAllianceScoring`, a library match's official score is
 * always already known, so this never returns null.
 *
 * Reuses `evaluatePracticeSessionFlags` exactly like solo mode (Zero
 * Entries / Unrealistic Entry / Repeat Attempt); `videoProgressAtFinish` is
 * always `null` — see docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md (P8) for why "Finished Early"
 * doesn't carry over to lobby mode's per-player video model.
