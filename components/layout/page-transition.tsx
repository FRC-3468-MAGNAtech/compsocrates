/**
 * Fade-in only — no exit animation, deliberately no AnimatePresence.
 *
 * The previous version wrapped the page in an AnimatePresence (without
 * `mode="wait"`) with a y-offset slide and a spring exit. Without `wait`, the
 * *outgoing* page stays in the document flow for the whole exit spring while
 * the incoming page mounts right below it, so the new page rendered lower
 * than its final position and then snapped up when the old one unmounted —
 * the "content starts too low, then jumps" bug (FIX1-1). A keyed element that
 * simply fades in has nothing in flow to leave behind, and the offset is
 * tiny enough (see pageTransitionVariants) that it can't read as a jump.
